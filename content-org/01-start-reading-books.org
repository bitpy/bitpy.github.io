I have decided to practice my English skill by reading English books.

The book I selected is a novel named "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee. I have read the version of Chinese.
It's an excellent story, and I like it. Because I knew the story already, it will be not too hard for me to read the English version, isn't it?

But, when I'm reading, a lot of new words that I don't know. As I read it by Kindle, I marked all of them by Kindle.

Now I'm seeking a method to remember those words. Check what I found:

- [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html][org-drill]]
- [[https://github.com/l3kn/org-fc][org-fc]]

They are both based on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition][Spaced repetition]] and Orgmode. For me the workflow I'm thought is:

1. Mark new words that I got from Books by Kindle.
2. Record them as flashcards by Orgmode.
3. Practice every day by upon tool.


For now, I should choose one from upon tools.
