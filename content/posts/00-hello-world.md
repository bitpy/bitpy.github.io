I want to share some useless thoughts in English, as I'm learning it. I believe that you won't learn it only if you use it.

There is no environment to use English, as I long live in China. So I'm thinking how to practice my English skill.
And here is what I thought: writing, writing in English. Then share them in this blog, make mistakes and excepting someone to point it out.

If you have some advice, please email me to <mailto:grayking.w@gmail.com>. Happy to hear!

Hello world!
