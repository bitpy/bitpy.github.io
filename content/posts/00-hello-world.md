I want to share some useless thoughts in English, as I'm learning it. I believe that you won't master it only if you use it.

There is no environment to use English, as I long live in China. So I'm seeking a method to practice my English skill.
And here is what I thought:writing, writing in English. Then share them in the blog, make mistakes, excepting someone to point it out.

First, some tools would be helpful. As I use Emacs as the editor, I enabled some plugins to check:

-   [Fly Spell](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FlySpell) to check the spell of words;
-   [flycheck-grammarly](https://github.com/emacs-grammarly/flycheck-grammarly) to use [grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to check the grammar of sentences.

Then, I want to say more about the blog. I'm using the [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) to generate the site. And writing posts by Emacs in [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/) format.
Yes, [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) only accepts Markdown files. But with the power of [ox-hugo](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo) here we are.

If you have some advice, please email me to <mailto:grayking.w@gmail.com>. Happy to hear!
